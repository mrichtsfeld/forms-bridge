Bridge your WordPress forms without code, add custom fields, use field mappers, set up a workflow and make your data flow seamlessly to your backend.

== Bridges ==

Think of a bridge as a pipeline through which your form submissions data flows to your backend or service. In the middle, you can add custom fields to the form submissions, use field mappers to rename and mutate your form responses, or use workflow jobs to process the data before it is sent over the wire. With bridges you can connect your WordPress forms to any kind of backend, it doesn't matter if it is a CRM, an ERP, a booking system or an email marketing platform, the only requirement is an HTTP API. If it has an API it can be bridged!

== Form builders ==

Form builders are well known plugins that add forms to WordPress. We do bridges, let them do the forms and then work together to make your business work with ease.

Forms Bridge supports the following form builders:

* [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/)
* [GravityForms](https://www.gravityforms.com)
* [WP Forms (PRO)](https://wpforms.com/)
* [Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/)
* [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce)

== Addons ==

Forms Bridge comes with free addons. Each addon adds to the plugin new bridges to work with specific APIs, new workflow jobs and bridge templates.

Forms Bridge has the following addons:

* [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)
* [Bigin](https://www.bigin.com/developer/docs/apis/v2/?source=developer)

== Backends ==

In Forms Bridge, a backend is a set of configurations that handles the information required to get your form submissions bridged over HTTP requests to remote systems.

To register a new backend you only have to set 3 fields:

1. A unique name for the new connection
2. The URL of your backend
3. An array of HTTP headers with connection metadata and credentials
4. Optional, an HTTP authentication credential (Basic, Bearer, etc)

Once registered, you can reuse your backend connection on your form bridges.

== Custom fields ==

Custom fields are data that will be added the bridge payload. Use them to store private data you don’t want to place on your public forms, like user emails, or config values, like product IDs or lead tags.

== Field Mappers ==

Field mappers are mutations with which you can rename your form submission fields and transform its values. Use them to make your form submissions to fit your backend API endpoint interface.

== Workflows ==

Make your form submissions flow through a chain of jobs that pre-process the data before it was sent over the wire. Think of workflow as a system to set up automations to run on each form submission.

== Templates ==

To streamline the bridge setup process, Forms Bridge comes packed with templates. Templates are blueprints of bridges you can use to set up your form integrations in a matter of minutes.
