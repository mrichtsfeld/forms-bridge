Bridge your WordPress forms without code, add custom fields, set up a workflow and make your data flow to your backend.

== Bridges ==

Think of a bridge as a pipeline through which your form submissions data flows to your backend or service. In the middle, you can add custom fields to the form submissions, use mappers to rename and mutate your form responses, or use workflow jobs to process the data before it is sent over the wire. It doesn't matter if you want to connect your forms to an ERP, a CRM or a mailing marketing platform, if it has an API it can be bridged!

== Integrations ==

Integrations are well known plugins that add forms to WordPress. We do bridges, let them do the forms and then work together to make your business work with ease.

Forms Bridge has integrations for:

* [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/)
* [GravityForms](https://www.gravityforms.com)
* [WP Forms (PRO)](https://wpforms.com/)
* [Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/)
* [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce)

== Addons ==

Forms Bridge comes with free addons. Each addon adds to the plugin new bridges to work with specific APIs, new workflow jobs and new bridge templates.

Forms Bridge has core support for generic REST API bridges and addons for:

* [Bigin](https://www.bigin.com/developer/docs/apis/v2/?source=developer)

== Backends ==

In Forms Bridge, a backend is a set of configurations that handles the information required to get your form submissions bridged over HTTP requests to remote systems.

To register a new backend you only have to set 3 fields:

1. A unique name for the new connection
2. The URL of your backend
3. An array of HTTP headers with connection metadata and credentials
4. Optional, an HTTP authentication credential (Basic, Bearer, etc)

Once registered, you can reuse your backend connection on your form bridges.

== Custom fields ==

Custom fields are data that will be added the bridge payload. Use them to store private data you don’t want to place on your public forms, like user emails, or config values, like product IDs or lead tags.

== Mappers ==

Use mappers to rename your form fields to fit the backend API schema.

== Templates ==

To streamline the bridge setup process, Forms Bridge comes packed with templates. Templates are blueprints of bridges you can use to setup your form integrations in a matter of minutes.
