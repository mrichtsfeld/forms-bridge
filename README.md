# Forms Bridge

Bridge your WordPress forms without code, add custom fields, use field mappers, set up a workflow and make your data flow seamlessly to your backend.

## Bridges

Think of a bridge as a pipeline through which your form submissions data flows to your backend or service. In the middle, you can add custom fields to the form submissions, use field mappers to rename and mutate your form responses, or use workflow jobs to process the data before it is sent over the wire. With bridges you can connect your WordPress forms to any kind of backend, it doesn't matter if it is a CRM, an ERP, a booking system or an email marketing platform, the only requirement is an HTTP API. If it has an API it can be bridged!

## Form builders

## Backends

In Forms Bridge, a backend is a set of configurations that handles the information required to get your form submissions bridged over HTTP requests to remote systems.

To register a new backend you only have to set 3 fields:

1. A unique name for the new connection
2. The URL of your backend
3. An array of HTTP headers with connection metadata and credentials
4. Optional, an HTTP authentication credential (Basic, Bearer, etc)

Once registered, you can reuse your backend connection on your form bridges.

## Custom fields

Custom fields are data that will be added the bridge payload. Use them to store private data you don’t want to place on your public forms, like user emails, or config values, like product IDs or lead tags.

## Field mappers

Field mappers are mutations with which you can rename your form submission fields and transform its values. Use them to make your form submissions to fit your backend API endpoint interface.

## Workflows

Make your form submissions flow through a chain of jobs that pre-process the data before it was sent over the wire. Think of workflow as a system to set up automations to run on each form submission.

## Templates

To streamline the bridge setup process, Forms Bridge comes packed with templates. Templates are blueprints of bridges you can use to set up your form integrations in a matter of minutes.

## Development

### API

The plugin offers some hooks to expose its internal API. Go to [documentation](https://formsb
ridge.codeccoop.org/documentation/#api) to see more details about the hooks.

### Dependencies

The repository handles dependencies as [git submodules](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutoria
ls/git-submodule).
In order to work local, you have to clone this repository and initialize its submodules
with this command:

```
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init
```

Once done, install JS dependenices with `npm install` and PHP dependencies with `composer install`.

### Build

Frontend builds are made with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). Once you
have your JS dependencies installed you can run `npm run dev` to perform
a live build, or `npm run build` to get a production build.

### Lint and format

For JavaScript the project uses [prettier](https://prettier.io/) as a formatter [eslint](https://eslint.org/) as the linter.

For PHP the project uses [phpcs](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) as the linter and [php-cs-fixed](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer/) as the formatter.

Lint and format will be applied to staged files before each commit. In addition, merge requests performs a lint test in order to be accepted.

### Tests

To run the projects test you have to execute the script `bin/install-wp-tests.sh` in order to get the WordPress test suit installed in your local machine. Once done, run `composer run test` to run project's unit tests.
