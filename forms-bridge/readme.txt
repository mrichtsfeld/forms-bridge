**Need a custom integration?**

Connect to any custom API using standard HTTP methods and authentication using the abstract **REST API** add-on. Perfect for integrating with proprietary or less common systems.

== Features ==

**Bridges**
Think of a bridge as a pipeline through which your form submissions data flows to your backend or service.

**Backends**
Think of it as a "connection profile" for your API. Save your API URL, headers, and credentials once, then reuse them across all your bridges. No need to re-enter details every time!

**Credentials**
Authenticate your HTTP requests using API keys, Basic Auth, OAuth, RPC credentials and Digest Auth.

**Custom fields & mappers**
Add hidden data (like user IDs or product codes) and rename/transform fields to match your API’s requirements.

**Workflows**
Chain together jobs to pre-process data before it’s sent. Filter, validate, enrich submissions automatically.

**Templates**
Use pre-built templates to integrate WooCommerce orders, CRM leads, or calendar events in minutes.

**Debugging console**
Monitor requests, responses, and errors in real time.
