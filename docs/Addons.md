# Addons

## Odoo

Odoo addon allows Forms Bridge to hook forms with Odoo's models. Let WordPress do the work is intended for and place your business logic on an ERP system, and bridge them on a unique leads pipeline that connects backend and frontend over the JSON-RPC API protocol.

To setup form hooks to bridge your forms and your Odoo, you will have to enable this addon. Once activated, Odoo will be shown as a new tab on the Forms Bridge settings page. Before you start to hook your forms, its worth to mention that to configure this addon's form hooks, the settings page will ask you for a database instead of a backend. This addon establishes connections with Odoo over the JSON-RPC API. This API requires some credentials to authenticate the requests. The addon handles this credentials as database access data, that you can configure in the databases panel. For each database access you will need to select a backend, a database name, a username and a password (or API-KEY). The addon requires, at least, one database access before you can start hooking your forms.

Google Sheets addon allow you to synchronize your website form submission with spreadsheets from google and decouple your webpage and your data sources and focus on what really matters.
